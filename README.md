# SoloMusicBot !
### This bot is not finished yet. It has many bugs. (Right now it isn't working)

Hello! This is my bot I'm making with JS!
Pretty much, the idea of it is that it can play music in a discord voice channel/voice call, the user can interact with the music with commands like `/pause` and `/play`.
\n
I have a few commands that you'll see in the command folder as well as some button handles in the button folder, it's quite a simple bot.

### Main Commands !

```
/play - Adds the song given to the queue
/pause - Pauses the current song playing
/unpause - Unpauses the current song
/queue - Manage/view the current song queue
/join - Join the bot to your discord voice channel
/help - Need help with the bot? Run this command!
/skip - Skip to the next song in the queue
```

## Help
