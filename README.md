# SoloMusicBot !
Hello! This is my bot I'm making with JS!
Pretty much, the idea of it is that it can play music in a discord voice channel/voice call, the user can interact with the music with commands like `/pause` and `/play`.
\n
I have a few commands that you'll see in the command folder as well as some button handles in the button folder, it's quite a simple bot (at the moment of me writing this it's pretty badly coded).

### Main Commands !

```
/play
/pause
/unpause
/queue
/join
/help
/skip
```

## Help

If you notice any problems with the bot, feel free to contact me and explain the problem! My Discord is `Jamieee#6862`.


## License

Yeah nah there aren't any licenses for this bot but please don't self host it! ❤️
