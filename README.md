Hello! This is my bot I'm making with JS!
Pretty much, the idea of it is that it can play music in a discord voice channel/voice call, the user can interact with the music with commands like `/pause` and `/play`.
\n
I have a few commands that you'll see in the command folder as well as some button handles in the button folder, it's quite a simple bot (at the moment of me writing this it's pretty badly coded).
